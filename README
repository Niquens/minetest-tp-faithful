This texture pack provides 32x32px textures similar to the default textures from minetest.
This is a Work-In-Progress (WIP), feel free to fork+pull-request if you want to make changes or add textures.

Current support:
- All minetest_game mods
- A few of BlockMen's mods
- One of Evergreen's mods
- One of Zeg9's mods
- The nether mod
- TNT mod
- Some of the moreblocks textures
- Some of the glooptest textures
Planned support for mods:
- Evergreen's mods
- Zeg9's mods
- 3darmor mod
- TNT and nuke mod
- Nether, carts, boats
- Homedecor
- Glooptest
- Moreblocks and moreores
- Technic (maybe not, it already has 32px textures)
- Mesecons (if it really looks better in 32px)
If you're a mod author, you may also make your own textures and submit them (pull-requests will be accepted faster than PMs or other).
You can also ask us to add support for the mods you like, but notice that our todo list is bigger than what is currently done ;-)
